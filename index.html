                                <h5>Education and Career Article</h5>
                                <p style="text-indent: 45px"> Hello, my name is Connor Christensen and I am currently a full time student studying Web Design and Development at UVU. While doing this, I work at the office of IT Asset Management at UVU, as well as take on the role of Assistant Manager at a restaurant called Blaze Pizza. If there is anything that I pride myself on, it is my work ethic. As you many know, juggling all of these many responsibilites can be a challenge, but nothing is more important to me than getting a good education and hitting the ground running once offered a position in my field of interest.</p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 45px">Currently, I am hoping to get accepted into the upper division classes at UVU into the Web and App development program to continue to work on and hone my skills as a coder. My main goal is to be graduated come Fall of 2023 and, if it's not too crazy of a hope, to have a full time job in the field before finishing school. While attending UVU, my goals for grades have always been an A minimum, and I am happy to say that I have been almost perfect in that regard. While there are some slip ups here and there in the General Education courses, my Digital Media courses, specifically the coding heavy ones, have always been first on my priority to focus on and turn in truly the best work that I can. My goal is to graduate on the timeline that I have set, and graduate with high marks as that will truly show myself that I was able to complete the required courses excellently. This, I think, will also boost my confidence when entering into the job force. </p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 45px">If I had to set an entry-level career goal for myself, it would not be anything too unreasonable. As I mentioned, I am currently working at the IT Asset Management shop, which is great and allowing me the opportunity to gain more experience than I currently have, however it is more focued on the physical machines. My entry-level goal would be to work on the software side of IT. I have always loved learning new ways to solve problems, and being able to jump into a junior development job would be perfect for me to learn the ropes of the industy, gain confidence in the knowledge that I have, as well as give me more opportunity to grow and learn more. While there are no specific companies in mind, I am looking forward to a possible internship in the coming fall to begin my journey into the industry.</p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 45px">As a long-range career statement, I would like to be the head of a UX/UI team eventually. While this is a little more front end than what I currently emjoy doing, that is not to say that I dislike the design process whatsoever. I had never really found myself to be the creative type until starting this major. I found that it is a little easier to be creative on a computer when you can have your designs be exactly the way you had invisioned them. While that will take a lot of experience and practice to work my way up to, starting on the back end of development would be all I need to be happy. That being said, before making the leap to a team lead on a UX project, I would like to be the Senior Developer on a project. This gives me the opportunity to really let myself shine, as well as learn to teach and mentor those who are new to the development game.</p>

                                <span>My Digital Media 1220 class was all about the Digital Design Essentials. Through this class, we learned how to use and master the basic digital tools that are involved in creating digital products. Throuhg out my time spent in this class, I mastered the Creative Cloud Applications, as well as learned about Web Elements and Systems Thinking. The image displayed is an example business card we made as one of our projects. This class was the first of many that taught me the most important thing about design, it is iterative. The other major skill learned through this course was that of problem solving and its relation to creativity. While creativity may seem like pure emotion, it can also be looks at with an view of logic to find the answers. Among the business cards, we also created logos, and studied as well as identified design principles. </span>

                                <span>This class consisted of learning how to affectively communicate digital design. The goal of this course was centered heavily on learning skills to help with my future career, such as how to Manage, Communicate, Visualize, and Utilize Design Software. This class took the basics that we had learned in 1220 and really put them to the test. As we had already learned many design principles, here was our opportunity to prove what we had learned. As the goal of this class was communication of digital design, we were tasked with learning to create efficient and accurate documentation. The provided image is a new MailBox UI that we were tasked with designing, which was also followed with documentation. Through this process, we also learned the most affective way to organize and provide information. The final skill that I left the course with is a proficient knowledge of layout softwares such as Adobe InDesign and Affinity Publisher.</span>

                                <span>My Digital Media 2120 class finally gave me a taste of what I learned to love, creating a website right before my eyes. With my little bit of background in Computer Science, it was enough for me to learn that I needed more than to just simply write code and functions, I loved the freedom and design aspects along with the code. Throughout this course, we started with the very basics of the Web and HTMl. From there, we learned about the process involved with planning a website, the basics of CSS, and finally into creating and learning the proper setup and rules for a web form. Through this class, I was able to get a better grasp of how a website should be setup, as well as putting to action the design principles that we had learned thus far. </span>

My time spent in this class was valuable, and consisted of learning modern design for webpages, as well as how to create a basic portfolio. Here we learned how to link projects and pull from an API as seen in my Pokemon API project. This was among my first experience with using Java Script up until this point and it is here that I found my love for web development. The other tool that I learned to use through this class was Code Pen. I had never been introduced to this before, but I find myself coming here often to test out code snippets or play around without any problems. Iconography also made an appearance during this class as we were tasked with adding icons to the footer and learning how to easily import them.</span>

                                <span>My Principles of Digital Design class taught me a lot about the design process, as well as many great tools that I will surely carry on with me through the remainder of my career. Among one of the greatest skills I learned here was how to correctly start and carry out a Sprint to help solve problems. As this was all about the principles, there was quite the final project we had to complete, luckily I had a lot of fun with mine. CLicking on the class will lead you to the documentation I completed when in this class. It's about a Gameification program designed to help students be more engaged with the content they are learning. It contains a little bit of my thought process and problems that I ran into along the way, from research to final showing of the product. Unfortunately the final product never made it past the final design stages, but should I find free time and expand my knowledge, this is something that I would love to look into completing. The final skill that I learned from this class is time management. I know this seems like a no brainer as a college student, however using a program for the first time called Toggl, which tracked and helped organize the time you spent on projects, turned out to be quite a difficult task for me. This did, however, teach me to focus on the task at hand when deciding to put time into it rather than jumping around like I had done in the past. </span>

                                <span>This course, Output for Mobile Media, was perhaps one of the most information filled classes that I have taken yet, and for good reason. This entire class was dedicated to the idea of formats and compression. As this world is turning into a more and more mobile one, there has never been a higher need for responsive websites, and one of the key factors in this is compression. Through this project, we learned about the different types of audio and video formats, how to successfully and best compress those files, and finished with a Use-Case Scenario where we could prove what we had learned throughout the course. One of the other things we had learned through the course, that I have also currently taken with me to the real world, is about Asset Management. This is extremely important when creating a website and when compressing as you don't wan to get confused on which image you are wanting to use for a certain query. Clicking on this course title will bring you to my final documentation of the class. Here I explore the different formats, the difference between lossy and lossless compression, how I currently am implementing Asset Management, and finally the documentation for the Use-Case Scenario. The final part of the documentation is worth a look as it showed the true power and proof for making sure to compress your images in certain ways. Maintaining quality, however still keeping a low load time is the key to a good website design. </span>
